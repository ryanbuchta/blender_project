# blender_project
MATLAB code solving for the flow inside a cylindrical domain with rotating floor and stationary walls (a simplified blender). The dimensions of the problem are reduced by assuming that the flow is centrosymmetric about the axis through the center of the cylinder, allowing us to reduce the 3D domain to a 2D rectangular cross-section inside the cylinder extending from the central axis to the edge. Using the streamfunction-vorticity formulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, we numerically solve (employing similarity transformations on the discretized equations) within the 2D domain [0,r]x[0,\Gamma] and use centrosymmetry to extrapolate the flow back to the full 3D domain.
